Anka's English lyrics have nothing to do with the original French music; My Way's lyrics tell the story of a man who, in his old age, contemplates his life as death approaches. He was satisfied with his lifestyle and life, did not live in a slump, dared to speak upright with his thoughts.",

        "description": "Moonglow is a 32-bar tune in the form of AABA.Moonglow appears in jazz fake books and lead sheets in the key of G, though it is also thought to originally be in the key of C.The melodic riff of the A section is composed of a repeated minor third interval followed by a major third interval and then a repeated note. Harmonic movement is largely in an ascending circle of fourths, or with descending chromatic substitutions, but there is also movement between thirds or between major and minor seventh chords. Minor seventh chords are often played in first inversion in this tune, and may therefore be thought of and notated as six chords of the relative major.",

        "description": "Winter Wonderland is a song written in 1934 by Felix Bernard and lyricist Richard Bernhard Smith. Due to its seasonal theme, it is often regarded as a Christmas song in the Northern Hemisphere. Since its original recording by Richard Himber, it has been covered by over 200 different artists.The song's lyrics were about a couple's romance during the winter season. A later version of Winter Wonderland (which was printed in 1947) included a new children's lyric that transformed it from a romantic winter interlude to a seasonal song about playing in the snow. The snowman mentioned in the song's bridge was changed from a minister to a circus clown, and the promises the couple made in the final verse were replaced with lyrics about frolicking. Singers like Johnny Mathis connected both versions of the song, giving Winter Wonderland an additional verse and an additional chorus.",
